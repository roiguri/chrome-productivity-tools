# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in three sizes:

- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (shown in browser toolbar)
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (shown in extensions management page)
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (shown in Chrome Web Store, if published)

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Simple Placeholder Icons

You can create simple colored squares with "E=" text using any image editor:

1. Create a new image with the required dimensions
2. Fill with a solid color (e.g., blue #4285F4)
3. Add white "E=" text in the center
4. Save as PNG

### Option 2: Online Icon Generator

Use an online tool like:
- [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- [Icon Generator](https://www.iconsgenerator.com/)

Upload a source image and generate all three sizes at once.

### Option 3: Design Tool

Create a custom icon in:
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- Inkscape (free)
- GIMP (free)

Export at 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels.

## Recommended Design

Consider an icon that represents equations, such as:
- Mathematical symbols (Σ, ∫, π, or just "=")
- Calculator or formula imagery
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use colors that stand out (blue, green, or purple work well)

## Temporary Solution

Until you add custom icons, Chrome will display a default puzzle piece icon for the extension. The extension will still work perfectly fine without custom icons.

## File Format

- Use **PNG format** with transparency
- Ensure exact pixel dimensions (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
- Keep file sizes small (< 50KB each)
